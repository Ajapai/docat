**Host your docs. Simple. Versioned. Fancy.**

## Getting started

The simplest way is to build and run the docker container:

```sh
docker build -t docat .
docker run -p 8000:80 docat
```

If you want to run the application otherwise look at the
[backend](backend/README.md) and [web](web/README.md) docs.
